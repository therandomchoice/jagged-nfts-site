# jagged-nfts site

In October 2021, a user with the nickname [jagged](https://foundation.app/@jagged)
came to the NFT marketplace [Foundation](https://foundation.app).
He began to buy all the NFTs with green frog Pepe.
The community noticed this and began to release more and more NFTs with Pepe.
In a few months, thousands of NFTs were sold, millions of dollars were spent.
This project is a site that shows money spent on Pepe based on
[etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) data.

[Site is deployed](https://jagged-nfts.herokuapp.com) on the Heroku platform.

Two plugins are required for deployment: Redis To Go and Scheduler to start worker.
